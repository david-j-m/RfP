## How Reiki Works

When we receive Reiki attunements, we become able to channel more of this Energy from the Universe into our bodies; it can then flow through our hands into our own bodies and into the bodies of other people and other living beings.  When we receive this Energy, we use it for healing that takes place on the subconscious level.  Together, balance, inner peace, and improved health allow us to become happier and more beautiful to ourselves and to others and eventually may bring us to a feeing of joyfulness in our lives.
