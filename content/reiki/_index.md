## Reiki

Reiki is the Japanese word for 'universal life force energy'.  We all have it; we can all use more.  The strength of the method of healing based on Reiki energy lies in its simplicity.  When we pass this energy through our hands and into our bodies, we use it to heal ourselves, physically, emotionally, and spiritually, eventually bringing ourselves to a state of emotional and spiritual balance, calm, inner strength, and joy.  We can also provide this energy to others so that they can heal themselves.  Though extremely simple, Reiki treatments can be surprisingly powerful and effective.  Reiki does not only relieve symptoms; Reiki treatments increase relaxation, ease pain, strengthen our immune systems, and heal the root causes of our illnesses.
