## How to Get Reiki

Reiki is passed from teacher to student in the form of Reiki attunements. There are several levels of Reiki practice:

<u>First Degree Reiki (RI):</u>
First Degree Reiki students can help themselves and others to heal by giving hands-on treatments to themselves, their relatives, or close friends (see below).


<u>Second Degree Reiki (RII):</u>
At the second degree level, we learn to use energetic symbols that permit us to increase the intensity of our hands-on treatments, and to send treatments at a distance.

<u>Professional Reiki Practitioner:</u>
Becoming a professional Reiki Practitioner is a more lengthy process during which students must take Second Degree Reiki Training, treat themselves regularly, and practice treating others on a volunteer basis.  Continuing to work with a Reiki Master helps students to work through their own problems before they start to work with others.

<u>Reiki Master and Teacher:</u>
Becoming a Reiki Master is not like 'choosing another job'.  It is a process of commitment to the Reiki healing path and commitment to passing the ability to work with Reiki to others, usually takes more than a year or even many years.
