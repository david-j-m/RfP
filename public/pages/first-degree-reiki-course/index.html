<h2 id="first-degree-reiki-course">First Degree Reiki Course</h2>

<p>A first degree Traditional Reiki course takes place over approximately 16 hours.  Most often, there are four sessions of four hours each.  These sessions can take place on consecutive days, or spaced as much as a week apart, or concentrated into two days (with two sessions each day).</p>

<p>Please contact us for details regarding paying for Reiki courses.</p>

<p>The course includes the following components:</p>

<p>Students are each given four attunements (also called initiations) that enable them to receive the energy and pass it through their hands;</p>

<p>Explanatory, background, and historical material about Reiki is provided to help the students understand how the method was discovered and developed and how the energy works;</p>

<p>Giving Reiki to another person requires only that the hands of the Reiki practitioner be on or near the recipient&rsquo;s body.  Students learn how to give themselves treatments and how to treat someone who is sitting in a chair or lying down.  They practice these skills under supervision.</p>

<p>After completing the course, students are encouraged to join weekly Reiki Sharing Meetings at which they share Reiki and continue to discuss their work in Reiki.</p>

<p>First Degree Reiki students can treat and heal themselves, and give Reiki treatments to relatives or close friends.  By itself, First Degree Reiki Training is not sufficient to enable students to earn a living as a practitioner.  To become a professional Reiki Practitioner, the Reiki student must take Second Degree Reiki Training, take further training, and be certified by the Reiki Master as a professional Reiki practitioner.</p>
