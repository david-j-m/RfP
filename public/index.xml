      <description>How to Get Reiki Reiki is passed from teacher to student in the form of Reiki attunements. There are several levels of Reiki practice:
First Degree Reiki (RI): First Degree Reiki students can help themselves and others to heal by giving hands-on treatments to themselves, their relatives, or close friends (see below).
Second Degree Reiki (RII): At the second degree level, we learn to use energetic symbols that permit us to increase the intensity of our hands-on treatments, and to send treatments at a distance.</description>

      <description>How Reiki Works When we receive Reiki attunements, we become able to channel more of this Energy from the Universe into our bodies; it can then flow through our hands into our own bodies and into the bodies of other people and other living beings. When we receive this Energy, we use it for healing that takes place on the subconscious level. Together, balance, inner peace, and improved health allow us to become happier and more beautiful to ourselves and to others and eventually may bring us to a feeing of joyfulness in our lives.</description>

      <description>Reiki Reiki is the Japanese word for &amp;lsquo;universal life force energy&amp;rsquo;. We all have it; we can all use more. The strength of the method of healing based on Reiki energy lies in its simplicity. When we pass this energy through our hands and into our bodies, we use it to heal ourselves, physically, emotionally, and spiritually, eventually bringing ourselves to a state of emotional and spiritual balance, calm, inner strength, and joy.</description>
